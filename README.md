# Colour-Detection-in-ML
In this Machine learning project weâ€™re going to use an RGB sensor to identify objects based on their color. A color detection algorithm identifies pixels in an image that match a specified color or color range. The color of detected pixels can then be changed to distinguish them from the rest of the image. This example introduces a workflow to take Simulink model of a color detection algorithm from simulation to deployment onto device: Simulate the color detection model Deploy the color detection model and use the Video Display block to show simulated data on the Android device Modify the color detection model to use real-time images from the Camera Block
